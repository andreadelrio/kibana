=== Role Mappings


Role mappings allow you to describe which roles to assign to your users
using a set of rules. Role mappings are required when authenticating via
an external identity provider, such as Active Directory, Kerberos, PKI, OIDC,
or SAML.

Role mappings have no effect for users inside the `native` or `file` realms.

To manage your role mappings, use *Management > Security > Role Mappings*.

NOTE: The role mapping UI will only be available if your license supports external
identity providers which can benefit from role mappings.
